Today is \today. \newline
``Hey man what is $5 - 1$?''\newline
This is a small new parapgraph that doesn't contain much useful info. Just another \LaTeX{} doc.Books are often typeset with each line having the same length. LATEX 
inserts the necessary line breaks and spaces between words by optimizing the contents of a whole paragraph. If necessary, it also hyphenates words that would not fit comfortably on a line. How the paragraphs are typeset depends on the document class. Normally the first line of a paragraph is indented, and there is no additional space between two paragraphs. Refer to section 6.3.2 for more information.
Not a new line?
% This is an epic comment

Is it cool to have a new paragraph here or not? Read\slash{} write\newline

Temp today  \today{} is $-30\, ^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$\newline
Another way to write it is as 30 \textcelsius{} is 86 \textdegree{}F

%Example 1
\ldots when Einstein introduced his formula
\begin{equation}
e = m \cdot c^2 \;
\end{equation}

%Example 2
\ldots from which follows Kirchhoff's current law:
\begin{equation}
\sum_{k=1}^{n} I_k = 0\;
\end{equation}

%Example 3
\ldots which has several advantages

\begin{equation}
I_D = I_F - I_R
\end{equation}
